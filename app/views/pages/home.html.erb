      <p class="poppins-light mb-4">As a seasoned photographer with over a decade of experience in capturing
            compelling visual stories, I am now channeling my creative energy into the
            world of web development. My journey through photography has honed my eye
            for detail, my appreciation for aesthetics, and my passion for
            storytelling—skills that seamlessly translate into crafting engaging and
            user-friendly websites.

                collaborate on innovative projects, and continue growing in this ever-evolving
                digital landscape. Let's connect and explore how we can create something
